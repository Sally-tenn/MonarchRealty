Build a comprehensive, scalable, and visually stunning real estate and property management web application with PostgreSQL backend and React TypeScript frontend. The app should feature a sleek modern UI with glassmorphism and 3D effects, advanced user authentication with multiple profiles and roles, full property management workflows, intelligent AI assistant support, rich analytics dashboards, tutorial system, and subscription plans. The solution must be production-ready, maintainable, and extensible.

Core Requirements & Features:
1. Frontend:
React 18 + TypeScript SPA with smooth client-side routing (Wouter or React Router)

Tailwind CSS for styling, implementing glassmorphism cards with blurred translucent backgrounds, 3D hover animations, gradient overlays, and floating hero elements

Fonts: Inter + Poppins with professional typography

Fully responsive design with 24px grid spacing, smooth scrolling, and elevated navigation bars with backdrop blur

Navigation Header Bar: top fixed with swipe-scroll categorized menu grouping all main pages & features (Properties, Dashboard, Tutorials, Pricing, Profile, etc.)

Hero Section: immersive, animated, detailed benefits, core solutions with data-driven metrics and clear CTAs (e.g. Start Free Trial, Watch Demo)

Property Listings: searchable, filterable by price, location, type, status, bedrooms, bathrooms, features, with cards showing images, price, brief details

Property Details Page: comprehensive info with image carousel, owner/agent info, features, map, and inquiry/contact forms

Dashboards: personalized property management panels with data visualization (charts for occupancy, revenue, inquiries)

Video Tutorial System: categorized tutorials with progress tracking and difficulty levels

AI Assistant: floating chatbot panel at bottom-right on every page, providing intelligent guidance, FAQs, video tutorial suggestions, and personalized solutions

Pricing & Subscription: clear tiered pricing plans with benefits, sign-up forms, and management

Authentication UI: registration, login, role-based access (user, agent, manager, admin), profile settings with advanced preferences

Accessibility: keyboard navigation, screen reader support, high contrast themes, voice command navigation

Advanced UI Features: dynamic theming with seasonal variations, drag-and-drop dashboard widgets, component-level A/B testing hooks

2. Backend:
Node.js + Express.js with TypeScript for REST API

PostgreSQL database integration via Drizzle ORM with strong typing and migration support

Database schema includes Users (with roles and subscription plans), Properties (detailed fields + images + MLS integration ready), Tutorials, User Progress, Chat Sessions (for AI), Subscriptions, Analytics

Secure authentication system with JWT/session handling, role-based authorization, and password hashing

CRUD endpoints for all main resources, advanced filters for property search

AI Assistant backend to store conversation history, context-aware response management

Analytics APIs for fetching metrics, supporting dynamic reporting and data visualization

Subscription management with status and billing dates

Video tutorial metadata and progress tracking APIs

3. Data & Sample Content:
Populate database with rich sample data including:

50+ property listings covering diverse types, locations, prices, features

Multiple user profiles: agents, owners, managers, and admins

20+ tutorials categorized by difficulty and topic

Subscription plans with realistic pricing and features

Simulated analytics data for demo dashboards

Chat session logs for AI assistant demo

4. Advanced Features & Enhancements (Challenge & Innovate):
Reframe: Instead of just building a typical property platform, build a smart adaptive UI that learns from user engagement and optimizes layout dynamically.

Implement AI-powered layout optimization that rearranges dashboard widgets based on usage patterns.

Integrate voice navigation and commands for accessibility and futuristic control.

Build a dynamic theming engine that changes colors and styles based on time of day, weather, or user preferences.

Include component-level A/B testing infrastructure to continuously improve UI/UX.

Use advanced data visualization with interactive charts (e.g. D3.js or Chart.js) supporting real-time analytics.

Create a white-label customization module allowing brand-specific styling for clients without code changes.

Add MLS live data integration stub ready for future real-time feeds.

Incorporate real-time notifications for property status updates and chat messages.

Prepare infrastructure for multi-language localization with typography adjustments.

5. Design & Style Guide:
Colors:

Primary: #2563EB (modern blue)

Secondary: #7C3AED (purple accent)

Background: #F8FAFC (light grey)

Glass: #FFFFFF20 (translucent white) with backdrop blur

Text: #1E293B (slate)

Success: #10B981 (emerald)

Typography: Inter & Poppins

UI Effects: glassmorphism with translucent frosted glass cards, 3D hover scale & shadow animations, gradient overlays on hero and CTAs

Layout: responsive grid with consistent 24px gutters, floating elements in hero section, elevated blurred navigation bar

Smooth scroll and micro-interactions on buttons and inputs

Consistent spacing, hierarchy, and clean readable text across all pages

6. Deliverables:
Fully working web app with frontend, backend, and database

Complete navigation structure with interconnected routes and subpages

Robust sample data seeding scripts

Well-documented API and frontend component structure

Deployment-ready setup for Replit or similar (env config, build scripts)

Instructions for extending features and customization

Test coverage for critical backend and frontend parts

Challenge Your Thinking:

Don’t accept generic UI/UX solutions — rethink user flows to minimize clicks and increase engagement.

Question default authentication flows; prioritize seamless onboarding and progressive profiling.

Go beyond flat designs — make every interaction memorable with subtle animations and feedback.

Ensure data privacy and security baked in, not bolted on.

Consider scalability and modularity from day one to avoid costly rewrites.
